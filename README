This is a simple toaster jquery plugin that you can use to show notifications.

Use the css to control the look of the toaster. Check out the examples for usage.

I'm using Google's Closure compiler to do the javascript minification/compiling and am including the shell script that I use. It does require that you include the compiler.jar
file or change the path to include it.

I haven't decided on any licensing as of yet, so just use it if you find it.
